Let's talk about
What's on your mind
Leave out your famous dream, oh
You say your man
Don't take the time
Don't see no fancy ring, ah yeah
Falling in love
On the first date
I don't even know your last name
You're living off daddy's money,
but honey
Even though
These are our best days
We only do things
In the worst way
Let your hair down and
Dance with me
Give into your dark side
Your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me
It feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me
Of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?
My lips are numb
Can't walk the line
Why don't you try it too?
I like the red
Hope you don't mind
And it tastes so good on you,
ooh, yeah
Falling in love
On the first date
I don't even know your last name
You're living off daddy's money
but honey
Even though
These are our best days
We only do things
In the worst way
Let your hair down
Won't you, babe?
Give into your dark side
Your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me
It feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me
Of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?
This life that you've known
was in control
Now that the lights start to go
it fills your soul
Just close your eyes
Let the night take you whole
Take you whole
Let it go let it go oh
Give into your dark side
Your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me
It feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me
Of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you, babe?
Give into your dark side
Your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me
It feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me
Of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?
