Bounty on my heart wanted dead or alive yeah
I been driving far to escape from this life yeah
Said I'd be a star way before I knew the price
Ever since i started paying I've been praying for a light
Cuz shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety
It won't leave me alone
I know I know I know
I should be
Better than I was
Get myself together cuz I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm never enough
I know I know I know
Ay
I been fucking up my sleep schedule
And i lost track of time I broke my bezel
Anxiety and oh yeah I'm depressed too
My bad that's probably why I just didn't text you back
I been trying to find way to help me relax
I underestimated this life yeah it's fast
And all of the light I had in my life's fading black
Cuz shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety
It won't leave me alone
I know I know I know
I should be
Better than I was
Get myself together cuz I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm never enough
I know I know
Bounty on my heart wanted dead or alive yeah
I been driving far to escape from this life yeah
Said I'd be a star way before I knew the price
Ever since i started paying I've been praying for a light
Cuz this shit shits been getting dark for me
Honestly
It's getting hard for me
I'm trying to keep my head afloat above the water
That's drowning me down
And down
Cuz shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety
It won't leave me alone
I know I know I know
I should be
Better than I was
Get myself together cuz I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm never enough
I know I know I know
