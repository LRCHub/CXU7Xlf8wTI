A trip beyond the real world
My soul is running scared
Into the realm of shadows
I've seen the underworld
I feel the evil spirits watching me at night
I'm so afraid to close my eyes
Raging rivers runs red
I'm on the abandoned ship
I need to scream
Welcome to the darkside
Welcome to my world
To my... nightmare
Welcome to...
A trip over the red line
I shake the hand of doom
Into the heart of darkness
I've seen the black rain fall
Dark figures dancing madly underneath the moon
I'm still afraid to close my eyes
