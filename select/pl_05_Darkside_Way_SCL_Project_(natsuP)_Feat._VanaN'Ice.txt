The people on the darkside
Are frightended of something
They will loose touch
With in our world
And time passes them
by eventually
They will turn to dust
And be scattered in the wind
The society remains
cold and gray
This gloomy society
Has created a pitiful life
The people on the darkside
And frightened of something
The people on the darkside
And frightened of something
They will loose touch
With in our world
This gloomy society
Has created a pitiful life
The people on the darkside
And frightened of something
This gloomy society
Has created a pitiful life
The people on the darkside
And frightened of something

Oh, Having attained power
Does it make you a sccess?
You are wrong!
Oh, Having attained welth
Does it make you a sccess?
Oh, Having attained power
Does it make you a sccess?
You are wrong!
This gloomy society
Has created a pitiful life
The people on the darkside
And frightened of something
This gloomy society
Has created a pitiful life
The people on the darkside
